# GUIDELINE
## Principle
<!--- OPERABLE: User interface components and navigation must be operable. This means that users must be able to operate the interface (the interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform) Make all functionality available from a keyboard. Give users enough time to read and use content. Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions. Help users navigate and find content. Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard. --->
<!--- PERCEIVABLE: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means that users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to all of their senses) Provide text alternatives for non-text content. Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia. Create content that can be presented in different ways, including by assistive technologies, without losing meaning. Make it easier for users to see and hear content. --->
<!--- UNDERSTANDABLE: Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. This means that users must be able to understand the information as well as the operation of the user interface (the content or operation cannot be beyond their understanding) Make text readable and understandable. Make content appear and operate in predictable ways. Help users avoid and correct mistakes. --->
<!--- ROBUST: Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. This means that users must be able to access the content as technologies advance (as technologies and user agents evolve, the content should remain accessible) Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools.--->

## Level of Conformance 
<!--- A (the minimum level of conformance), the Web page satisfies all the Level A Success Criteria, or a conforming alternate version is provided.--->
<!--- AA the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided--->
<!--- AAA  the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.--->
