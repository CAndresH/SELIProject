- Point 2.b. "The sign-in windows set by default the e-mail address", I prefer to not use the autocomplete function to set the email or the username, this is a security aspect. If I understand in a wrong way this requirement please let me know.
- Point 2.c. "There is no option to reset or retrieve the password. This functionality is necessary in scenarios where users forget the password", I can't implement this feature because I need a email server to reset the password, I request if any body could configure this email server long time ago.
- Point 2.d. "In the  “Tutor sign-up” windows there are two options to select once the form is filled.", please send me an image of which are the 2 options that you are describing.
- Point N7 For 50 mb connection some pages do not load  or time-out. In my case I have a 3mb connection and every page has a successful load, in incognito browser (no cache).
